I am a graduate student in [CS at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). Before that, I obtained my B.S. degree in Statistics & Computer Science, from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I have a handsome boyfriend Daniel =)


I have a strong background in full stack development. For backend techniques, I’m skilled in Express.js, Flask, ASP.NET Core, Hadoop and so on. For frontend, I’m adept at React.js, Vue.js, CSS. I have experience in databases such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch. I conducted extensive internships and projects. I was a software engineer intern at [NetEase](https://ir.netease.com/) in 2020 and [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com/global/about/) in 2021. I’m now actively seeking Summer 2022 SWE Intern opportunities.
